## What is zkLink？
zkLink is a **multi-chain interoperability network** powered by **zero-knowledge** technology.

By connecting various public chains and Layer2 protocols, zkLink's multi purpose protocol enables developers and traders to benefit from liquidity on separate ecosystems with a seamless multi-chain user experience, contributing to a more accessible and efficient DeFi ecosystem for everyone.

> **🥇** zkLink innovatively applies **[zero-knowledge](/docs/Technology/Technology)** technology to multi-chain interoperability with a trustless and decentralized **[separation of powers](/docs/Technology/About-Security)** design that push forward the security level to a next generation. Moreover, zkLink eliminates the disparity among stablecoins from different blockchains and of different types, achieving multi-chain liquidity aggregation via a unique **[protocol-controlled-debt (PCD)](/docs/Technology/PCD)** mechanism that creates a efficient, cost-friendly, and easy-to-use infrastructure.

## Features
### Zero-knowledge Proofs with Zero Security Compromise
Zero-knowledge validity proofs are mathematically certified to guarantee only valid transactions are executed and cannot be manipulated or falsified, and hence ensure security of funds.

- In virtue of ZK-Rollup's on-chain data availability, account states can always be rolled back in case of attacks, even when all the data on zkLink Layer2 Engine is lost.
- Zero knowledge guarantees that nobody, including the platform itself, can upload fake zk_proof to the main chain.


### A Rigorous Consensus Mechanism with Checks and Balances
A light oracle network independently ensures the consistency of multi-chain states. Such separation of powers in the verification and judgment process ensures no single party controls asset security or is capable of malicious behavior.

- The checks and balances design guards zkLink protocol against economic attack from both external hackers and internal stakeholders by assuring that no single branch has too much power.


### Multi-chain Liquidity Aggregation
With zkLink’s unique design of a protocol-controlled-debt (PCD) mechanism, stablecoins from different blockchains and of different types are safely and efficiently aggregated into one single coin.

- A unified currency for all purposes on the zkLink L2 ecosystem.
- No need of multiple wallets for separate chains.
- Minimum friction and finality time.
