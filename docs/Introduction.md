## What is zkLinkï¼Ÿ
zkLink is a **unified, multi-chain L2 network** powered by **zero-knowledge** technology.

By connecting various blockchains and Layer2 protocols, zkLink's unified, multi-purpose network protocol enables developers and traders to leverage liquidity from isolated chains and offer a seamless multi-chain user experience, contributing to a more accessible and efficient DeFi ecosystem for everyone.

>**ðŸ¥‡** zkLink innovatively applies **[zero-knowledge](/docs/Technology/Technology)** technology to multi-chain interoperability with a trustless and decentralized **[separation of powers](/docs/Technology/About-Security)** design that safeguards the security of assets and trades. Moreover, zkLink eliminates the disparity among stablecoins from different blockchains and of different types, achieving multi-chain liquidity aggregation to form a massive stablecoin liquidity pool via a unique **[protocol-controlled-debt (PCD)](/docs/Technology/PCD)** mechanism, delivering a capital efficient, cost-friendly, and easy-to-access infrastructure.

## Features
### Zero-knowledge Proofs with Zero Security Compromise
Zero-knowledge validity proofs are mathematically certified to guarantee only valid transactions are executed and cannot be manipulated or falsified, and hence ensure security of funds.

- In virtue of ZK-Rollup's on-chain data availability, account states can always be rolled back in case of attacks, even when all the data on zkLink Layer2 Engine is lost.
- Zero knowledge guarantees that nobody, including the platform itself, can upload fake zk_proof to the main chain.


### A Rigorous Consensus Mechanism with Checks and Balances
A light oracle network independently ensures the consistency of multi-chain states. Such separation of powers in the verification and judgment process ensures no single party controls asset security or is capable of malicious behavior.

- The checks and balances design guards zkLink protocol against economic attack from both external hackers and internal stakeholders by assuring that no single branch has too much power.


### Multi-chain Liquidity Aggregation
With zkLinkâ€™s unique design of a protocol-controlled-debt (PCD) mechanism, stablecoins from different blockchains and of different types are safely and efficiently aggregated into one single coin.

- A unified currency for all purposes on the zkLink L2 ecosystem.
- No need of multiple wallets for separate chains.
- Minimum friction and finality time.
