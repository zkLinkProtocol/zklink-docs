## Welcome to zkLink

**zkLink** is the first multi-chain integration DEX based on ZK-Rollup technology, which aggregates the liquidity of different ecosystems, and makes it possible for native assets on different chains to interact and pair with each other. The platform adopts zero-knowledge technology and the DAO governance model to ensure the security and consistency of multi-chain asset interoperability, creating multi-chain DeFi scenarios such as swapping, loaning and revenue aggregating with a secure, efficient and low-cost user experience.
