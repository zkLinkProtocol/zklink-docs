## What is zkLinkï¼Ÿ
zkLink is a **trading-focused multi-chain L2 network** with **unified liquidity** secured by **ZK-Rollups**.

zkLink ecosystem connects various L1 chains and L2 networks that enables developers and traders to leverage unified liquidity from isolated chains with a secure and seamless user experience, contributing to a more accessible and efficient DeFi ecosystem for everyone.

>**ðŸ¥‡** zkLink innovatively applies **[zero-knowledge](/docs/Technology/Technology)** technology to multi-chain interoperability with a trustless and decentralized **[separation of powers](/docs/Technology/About-Security)** design that safeguards the security of assets and trades as well as multi-chain data transits. Moreover, zkLink eliminates the disparity among stablecoins from different blockchains and of different types, achieving multi-chain liquidity aggregation to form a massive stablecoin liquidity pool via a unique **[protocol-controlled-debt (PCD)](/docs/Technology/PCD)** mechanism, delivering a capital efficient, cost-friendly, and easy-to-access infrastructure.

## Features
### Zero-knowledge Proofs with Zero Security Compromise
Zero-knowledge validity proofs are mathematically certified to guarantee only valid transactions are executed and cannot be manipulated or falsified, and hence ensure security of funds.

- In virtue of ZK-Rollup's on-chain data availability, account states can always be rolled back in case of attacks, even when all the data on zkLink Layer2 Engine is lost.
- Zero knowledge guarantees that nobody, including the platform itself, can upload fake zk_proof to the main chain.


### A Rigorous Consensus Mechanism with Checks and Balances
A light oracle network independently ensures the consistency of multi-chain states. Such separation of powers in the verification and judgment process ensures no single party controls asset security or is capable of malicious behavior.

- The checks and balances design guards zkLink protocol against economic attack from both external hackers and internal stakeholders by assuring that no single branch has too much power.


### Native Asset Aggregation From Multiple Chains
dApps built on zkLinkâ€™s L2 network leverage seamless multi-chain liquidity, with rapid deployment solutions for decentralized and non-custodial order book, AMM, derivatives, and NFT exchanges.

- A unified currency for all purposes on the zkLink L2 ecosystem.
- No need of multiple wallets for separate chains.
- Minimum friction and finality time.
