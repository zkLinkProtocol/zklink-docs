## What is zkLinkÔºü
zkLink is an ultra **secure**, **chain-to-chain interoperability** protocol powered by **zero-knowledge** technology.

As a ‚Äùconnector‚Äù among diverse ecosystems, zkLink cooperates with various public chains and Layer2 protocols to provide a more convenient and secure chain-to-chain trading environment, contributing to a more accessible and efficient DeFi ecosystem for everyone.

> **ü•á** Suppose that traders are able to swap from SRM on Solana for CAKE on BSC within 45 seconds, and developers are able to leverage zkLink SDK as a built-in solution for their cross chain liquidity transfer: this all happens with **a secure, fast, cost-friendly experience**, when zkLink adopts recursive SNARKs to guarantee the validity of cross-chain transactions.

## Features
### Zero-knowledge Proofs
Zero-knowledge validity proofs are mathematically certified to guarantee only valid transactions are executed and cannot be manipulated or falsified, and hence ensure security of funds.

- In virtue of ZK-Rollup's on-chain data availability, account states can always be rolled back in case of attacks, even when all the data on zkLink Layer2 Engine is lost.
- Zero knowledge guarantees that nobody, including the platform itself, can play maliciously can upload fake zk_proof to the main chain.


### Trustless and Decentralized Security Schema
With our ZK-Rollup protocols, DAO, and light oracle network, we offer a rigorous security schema with checks and balances, and a censorship-resistant network of provers and verifiers.
- Such separation of powers is well designed to guard against economic attack from both external hackers and internal stakeholders, by ensuring no single branch has too much power.


### A Seamless and Easy-to-Use Trading Experience
Multiple blockchains are linked together with liquidity aggregation, allowing direct cross-chain traders to tap into multiple liquidity pools, and successfully complete their trades with low slippage and guaranteed finality.
- Traders can now directly exchange one token to another kinds from another chain, with **only a few clicks**.
- Different from other chain-interoperation platforms where users get stable-coins or mapping assets on the target chain, on zkLink they receive their target tokens, **saving much time & effort**.
