With the explosion of interest in DeFi in recent years, high gas fees have driven developers and traders from Ethereum to new high-performance chains such as Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Solana.

**The crypto world is generally accepted as having a multi-chain, multi-layer future**, where users navigate among different chains to meet their diverse demands, utilizing a mixed bag of crypto tokens.

This vision, while creating huge value for DeFi, also presents many problems:

1. <span className="highlight">Liquidity segmentation</span>: As next-generation ecosystems form heterogeneous silos with different consensus mechanisms, ledgers, and incompatible technologies, it is difficult for users to hold assets on or trade between separate chains by themselves, resulting in a low capital utilization rate. This, in turn, raises the cost for new chains and projects to acquire users.

2. <span className="highlight">The difficulty of navigation</span>: Currently, when a trader wants to swap tokenA on chainA to tokenB on chainB, they usually have to first swap tokenA to a stablecoin in a local DEX and find a Bridge to transit it to chainB before finally swapping the stablecoin to tokenB. This lengthy process takes significant time and effort, involving multiple networks and gas fees. In addition, the poor user experience of cross-chain transactions often stunts the enthusiasm of users and traders to use innovative projects and applications.

3. <span className="highlight">Cross-chain security</span>: The biggest technical challenge in chain interoperability is guarding asset security during chain-to-chain communication, which is vulnerable to many potential hacks or errors. Most chain-interoperability protocols adopt a multi-sig (group of nodes within a POS network) to verify change-in-states and cross-chain status, of which the security assumption is based on token values of the POS network.

In this background, users either separate their assets to multiple ecosystems with low capital utilization, or pay high fees for multiple transactions at centralized exchanges in a laborious process. The latter goes against the principle of decentralization and privacy due to mandatory KYC requirements and the tracking of transfers by CEXs.

If there is a decentralized ecosystem that not only solves liquidity problem but also provides CEX-like user experience, it will bring huge value to the DeFi-verse.
