DeFi-verse is burgeoning, with players seeing a surging number of Dapps spread over multiple public chains, and holding a long list of tokens. As the competition for computing resources becomes increasingly intense, the value of Ethereum has been spilled over into high-performing public chains represented by Polygon / Solana, and Layer 2 scaling solutions such as Avalanche. It is generally accepted that **a multi-chain, multi-layer infrastructure will be the future of blockchain**, with each nurturing its own blossoming eco with DeFi apps. Users no longer expect a single chain to fulfill all their needs of token interaction, instead, they depend on scattered protocols in each market segment.


This, however, is a double-edged sword: as these next-generation ecosystems gradually contribute to a diverse DeFi-verse, they also form their own heterogeneous silos, locking users and assets into their respective ‚Äòisland‚Äô. **Liquidity segregation makes it impossible for traders to hold assets on or trade between separate chains and Layer2 projects by themselves**, since the consensus mechanism, the ledger, and the underlying technology are incompatible. This could, in turn, hinder the long-term development of DeFi.


This could, in turn, hinder the long-term development of DeFi where the only possible path of multi-chain token interoperability is centralized exchanges. Which can only be a temporary remedy rather than a long-term solution in a world that advocates decentralization, since the opportunity cost and risk cost for long-tail users to swap multi-chain assets via a CEX can be unbearably high.

To provide a better user experience for traders, zkLink enables cross-chain swaps between tokens from different Layer1 ecosystems without requiring users to first deposit tokens to zkLink Layer2 Engine. While cross-chain transactions on other cross-chain protocols typically take about 10 minutes or more to complete, zkLink‚Äôs cross-chain transactions on high-performance chains such as Polygon and BSC take less than a minute. zkLink adopts zero-knowledge technology to ensure security and interoperability, creating multi-chain DeFi scenarios with a secure, efficient, and low-cost user experience.

In addition to efficient cross-chain functionality for its users, zkLink empowers developers and projects to bring the same fast, secure transactions to their respective platforms through the zkLink SDK, enabling even more interconnectivity between and across multiple chains and boosting the overall interoperability of the entire blockchain ecosystem.
