The world of DeFi is burgeoning, with players seeing a surging number of Dapps spread over multiple public chains, and holding a long list of tokens. As the vying for computing resource is becoming increasingly fierce, the value of Ethereum has spilt over into high-performing public chains represented by Polygon / Solana, and Layer 2 scaling solutions such as Optimism. It is settled that **a multi-chain, multi-layer infrastructure would be the future of blockchain**, with each nurturing their own blossoming eco with DeFi apps. Users no longer expect a single chain to fulfill all their needs of token interaction, instead they depend on scattered protocols in each market segment.


This is a double-edged sword: in the meantime that the development of these next-generation ecosystems contribute to the growing DeFi, they also form their own heterogeneous silos, locking users and assets into their respective island. **Liquidity segregation makes it impossible for traders to hold assets on or trade between separate chains and Layer2 projects by themselves**, since the consensus mechanism, the ledger, and the underlying technology are incompatible. This could, in turn, hinder the long-term development of DeFi where the only possible path of multi-chain token interoperability is centralized exchanges. Which can only be a temporary remedy rather than a long-term solution in a world that advocates decentralization, since the opportunity cost and risk cost for long-tail users to swap multi-chain assets via a CEX can be unbearably high.
