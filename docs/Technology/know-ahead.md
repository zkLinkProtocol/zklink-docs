Regarding chain interoperation solutions, here is a list of questions you might be interested in - click and navigate yourself to the answer.

- <span className="highlight">Security</span>: in the current blockchain world, security is alway the top priority. Liquidity providers should be convinced that their funds are safe, while traders must be assured that they can acquire the correct amount of tokens.

- <span className="highlight">Liquidity aggregation</span>: the continuously emerging blockchains and scaling solutions are isolating the liquidity of DeFi-verse as a whole, forming numerous asset silos. If a chain interoperation protocol could aggregate the fragmented liquidity from separated chains and Layer2 networks, it could provide a more user-friendly trading environment, creating huge values. For example, USDC from Ethereum and Starknet are merged into the same coin in a single pool on zkLink.

- <span className="highlight">Compatibility</span>: most chain-interoperation protocols support only EVM, whereas users are in need of a more compatible solution in a world with both EVM and other infrastructures. In virtue of ZK-Rollup, the only condition for a qualified chain connecting to zkLink is the capability of testifying zero-knowledge proves, meaning that zkLink is able to support any smart-contract-executable chains.

- <span className="highlight">Low cost</span>: as a derivative of ZK-Rollup solution, zkLink is born with scaling capability, resulting in low transaction costs. As a multi-chain ZK-Rollup, zkLink has higher flexibility to choose a suitable L1 to meet the data availability requirement.

- <span className="highlight">Extra consensus</span>: an additional consensus mechanism is a necessary component in chain-to-chain communication to guarantee the reliability of sending/receiving data from other chains. The entire process should be transparent enough for community members to monitor and find out unusual status, and to be simple enough to prevent inconsistent communication.
