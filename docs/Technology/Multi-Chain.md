# Multi-Chain

---


**zkLink** connects separate Layer1 networks with a single Layer2 network, so that tokens belonging to different ecosystems can be directly swapped with each other freely on this second layer. The Layer2 network will generate zero-knowledge proofs of the off-chain state on a regular basis and upload them to respective Layer1 contracts for verification.

** More specified technical models for multi-chain asset interoperability will be disclosed at a future date.
