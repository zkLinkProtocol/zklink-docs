# Roadmap

## Current Version

- Support Fast Cross Chain Swap. Realize chain-to-chain liquidity transfer in a fast and secure way fired by fast withdraw technology.

- Support Cross-chain Bridge, achieve multi-chain asset mapping without L2 liquidity.

- Support L2 Liquidity, aggregate multi-chain liquidity on Layer2 network.
- Support L2 LP withdrawal to L2. The LP token of zkLink can be interacted with all kinds of smart contracts on Layer1 in the form of NFT.
- Support L2 Mirror (Stablecoin Swap), with a stablecoin-specialized AMM curve. Lowers slippage and higher capital efficiency.
- Support API service for other Dapps to plug in zkLink service.

## The Future
- Further aggregate more chains and Layer2 protocols, constructing a trustless consensus mechanism, and a ledger system which supports multi-chain tokens. On top of the ZK base chain, support more basic functions:
  - Support balance account book of multi-chain tokens
  - simple atomic swap
  - Support all functions of ERC-20 protocol
  - Support common functions of ERC-721 and indivisible tokens
  - Support the upload of customized message to Layer1

- Based on the chain-to-chain consensus mechanism, construct a EVM-compatible side chain, where multi-chain DeFi scenarios can be easily deployed.
