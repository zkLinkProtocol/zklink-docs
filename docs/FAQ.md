# FAQ


## Q. What is zkLink?
>zkLink is a unified multi-chain trading infrastructure secured with zk-SNARKS, empowering the next-generation of decentralized trading products such as order book DEX, NFT marketplaces, among others.

>By connecting various L1 blockchains and L2 networks, zkLink's unified, multi-purpose ZK-Rollup middleware enables developers and traders to leverage aggregated assets and liquidity from different chains and offer a seamless multi-chain trading experience, contributing to a more accessible and efficient DeFi ecosystem for all.


## Q. Is zkLink still a cross-chain DEX?
>zkLink will not directly offer a decentralized exchange service. Instead, you will see other DeFi projects utilize our technology. We believe zero-knowledge will be a game changer for the multi-chain DeFi-verse and will help deliver a new era of security, speed, and lower cost to the end user.

## Q: How will the testnet change?
> The testnet is now a suite of demos to showcase use cases built upon our high-level APIs. Anyone is welcome to use our demos, and we are happy to receive feedback and ideas in our Discord community.

## Q: What will be the utility of the points (Galaxy NFT points) accrued on the testnet demos?
>Since zkLink will now no longer be operating a DEX, the original yield boost will no longer be usable on zkLink directly.   
<br/>
Instead, we plan to work with one of our ecosystem partners for zkLink Loyalty NFT rewards to boost yield farming on their platform.  
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, we are keeping records of all the points accrued so far, which will be utilized at a later date.  
<br/>
<br/>
We will also have new incentives for developers to build new features on top of the zkLink L2 network.  
<br/>


## Q: Will zkLink have a token sale?
>The date and details of a potential token sale and whitelist campaign is yet to be determined.
<br/>
Keep following our official social media channels - and ignore any rumors of any fake IDO/ICO/private sale notices.
<br/>

<span className="highlight">Important: We do not yet have a token, so be aware of scams. All announcements will be made to @all at our official Telegram, Discord, and Twitter channels, and we will never contact any community member directly.</span>



## Q. Has there been a change in the zkLink team? Is zkLink hiring?
> The team has not changed and we are in fact expanding! If you are a developer with experience in Solidity, Rust, or ZK-proofs, feel free to speak to us.

## Q. Will you continue to maintain the zkLink community now that you are not running a DEX?
>Yes! Community is core to everything we do at zkLink. We’ve seen the fast growth of our Telegram, Twitter, Discord, and testnet users, and we would like to thank everyone for their support so far; and hope you’ll continue with us into the future.
<br/>
Going forward, our community will be more technology focused, and we will have new developer-focused incentives and programs.
