## What is zkLink

Q. What is zkLink?

A. zkLink is the first multi-chain integration DEX based on ZK-Rollup technology, which aggregates the liquidity of different ecosystems, and makes it possible for native assets on different chains to interact and pair with each other. The platform adopts zero-knowledge technology and the DAO governance model to ensure the security and consistency of multi-chain asset interoperability, creating multi-chain DeFi scenarios such as swapping, loaning and revenue aggregating with a secure, efficient and low-cost user experience.

Q. What product features can zkLink offer?

A.  As a multi-chain integration dex, zkLink functions as the "connector" between separate public chains, providing users with DEX scenarios in cross-chain assets in a time/monetary-cost friendly manner. zkLink v1 can provide the following features:

1. "one-click" swapping with assets which are native for projects of different ecological types and public chains. For example, users can swap UNI on Ethereum for CAKE on BSC via zkLink with only one click.
2. "one-click" stablecoin swapping on different chains or of different kinds. For example, on zkLink's Layer2 network, users can not only transfer their USDT on Ethereum (ERC-20) to BSC (BEP-20), but also swap their USDT on Ethereum to USDC on BSC.

Q. What are the fees for using zkLink's cross-chain swapping?

A. Users pay 0.3%(待定) of the sum as transaction fees, which goes directly to liquidity providers. In addition, users pay the gas fee, which is typically very low since zkLink batches hundreds of transactions into one, and all users share this gas fee.

## About technology

Q. How zkLink achieve chain interoperability.

A. zkLink connects separate Layer1 networks with a single Layer2 network, so that tokens belonging to different ecosystems can be directly swapped with each other freely on this second layer, without an intermediate token. The Layer2 network will generate zero-knowledge proofs of the off-chain state on a regular basis and upload them to respective Layer1 contracts for verification. Users will see the pairs that have never been seen before, such as: CAKE-SUSHI, BNB-HT, BUNNY-COW, etc.

Q. What are the competitive edges of the technology zkLink applies.

A. zkLink is the first Layer2 cross-chain DEX that adopts ZK-Rollup technique. The innovative combination creates a time/monetary/learning/mental-cost friendly user experience.  

Deployed on Layer2, zkLink avoids traffic congestion on the main chain, increasing transaction speed. 

By batching hundreds of transactions before interacting with Layer2, zkLink help users reduce gas fee since it is shared by all users involved in that batch.

 Most importantly,  zkLink adopts zero-knowledge technology to guarantee the data consistency of Layer1 and Layer2, while eliminating the two-week long dispute time and reaching finality, so that users can pull out tokens immediately. 

In addition, zkLink will refer to Uniswap V3 on concentrated liquidity so that capital eﬀiciency could be increased by about 4,000 times in the following version.

Q. How are security and privacy guaranteed with zkLink. 

A. zkLink's layer2 could achieve the same security level as Ethereum Layer1, and this is assured by the adoption of zero-knowledge. The Layer2 network will generate zero-knowledge proofs of the off-chain state on a regular basis and upload them to respective Layer1 contracts for verification, making sure that the transaction is correctly approved and signed bu users and the account balance on Layer1 (the mainchain) is correctly updated. In this way, the security of assets and transactions is guaranteed by cryptography rather than game theory and economic models, meaning that nobody, including the platform itself, is able to jeopardize the security of assets, and users are able to withdraw tokens losslessly under extreme cases.

Q. Are zkLink's smart contracts audited?

A. Yes. All of zkLink's code and smart contracts are audited by Certik. 

## What is ZKL

Q. What is ZKL?

A. ZKL is the governance token of zkLink, and is an ERC-20 token. The total supply of ZKL is 1,000,000,000. For more detailed information and token economy, please refer to zkLink Whitepaper: (链接)

Q. How can users acquire ZKL

A. 

1. becoming a staking node: users can compete for the role of the staking node by locking ZKL, and will win ZKL as rewards. 
2. provide liquidity / staking: user can provide liquidity to trading pairs, or pledge idle tokens on zkLink and get ZKL as rewards.
3. campaigns and community reward: users who offer constructive suggestions or make contribution to product design / community / resource referral.

Q. How holders of ZKL benefit from it?

A. 

1. becoming the staking node: users can compete for the role of the staking node by locking ZKL, and will win ZKL as rewards. 
2. proposal initiation and voting: users can participate in our DAO governance by holding ZKL, and can initiate a proposal by burning certain amount of ZKL. 
3. get airdrop: those who have been holding ZKL for a considerable time can expect irregularly airdrop as a reward.
