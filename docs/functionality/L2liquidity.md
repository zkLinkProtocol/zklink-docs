# L2 Liquidity

---

AMM-based, Layer2 liquidity pools composed of LP tokens from two separate chains, providing support for L2 Swap and L2 Mirror (Stable Swap). LP providers would receive high rewards by easy steps without firstly depositing to L2, fulling utilizing the LP tokens theyâ€™ve earned from other DEXs - reaping twice with single staking.
