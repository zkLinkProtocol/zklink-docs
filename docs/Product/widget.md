# Widget & SDK

---
With the support from FastCrossChainSwap, zkLink provides a brand new deposit channel for third-party DeFi projects by offering visualization component, which takes only a few steps to be plugged in (no coding required).

With zkLink widget settled, users can play with third-party DeFi (such as Vaults, Lending, etc.) with any kinds of assets from any public chains.

<div className="cancel-md-margin">

As a developer, imagine that your user needs to stake UNI to participate a campaign on your platform, but the only token that he/she holds is CAKE. If zkLink widget is plugged in your protocol, that user can simply swap his/her CAKE to UNI without even navigating out of the website.
