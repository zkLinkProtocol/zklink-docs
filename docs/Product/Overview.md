# Overview

---
As a trustless chain-to-chain interoperability protocol, zkLink functions as a middleware to connect isolated chains, empowers traders to solve liquidity problems, and provides multi-chain deployment solutions for Dapps developers. By connecting separate Layer1 networks with a single Layer2 engine, tokens belonging to different ecosystems can be directly swapped with each other on this second layer, without an intermediate token. zkLink achieves .

zkLink addresses the liquidity segmentation problem in a decentralized way. With the implementation of zero-knowledge technology, we realized cross-chain liquidity pairs on zkLink Layer2 Engine, and managed to provide fast cross-chain swaps service on Layer1 by a broker mechanism.


zkLink v1 will support Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and in the foreseeable future, will also be connected with other smart chains and layer2 protocols such as Solana, Optimism, Fantom, etc.
