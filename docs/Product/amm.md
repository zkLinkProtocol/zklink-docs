# Use Case 2: Multi-Chain AMM Curves

---
zkLink supports multi-chain liquidity pairs consisting of native tokens from separate chains, of any type, such as ETH-SOL, UNI-CAKE, USD-XXX, and more. Multiple trading curves are supported: constant product curve (UNI V2), optimized stableswap curve (Curve.fi), and concentrated liquidity model (UNI V3) - in development.

- **One-stop multi-chain trading user experience**
  - Negligible slippage on stablecoins.
  - No need to install multiple wallets from each chain.

- **Real-time settlement**
