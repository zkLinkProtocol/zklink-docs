As a multi-chain integration dex, zkLink functions as the "connector" between separate public chains, providing users with DEX scenarios in cross-chain assets in a time/monetary-cost friendly manner. 

zkLink connects separate Layer1 networks with a single Layer2 network, so that tokens belonging to different ecosystems can be directly swapped with each other freely on this second layer, without an intermediate token. Users will see the pairs that have never been seen before, such as CAKE-SUSHI, BNB-HT, USDT(ERC20)-USDT(BEP20), BUSD-HUSD, WBTC-BTCB, etc.  

To maximize product performance and optimize user experience, zkLink adopts zero-knowledge technology. Apart from unimpeded traffic and real-time transaction on Layer2, users can expect a negligible gas fee largely shared since hundreds of transactions are batched and compressed into one pack. Moreover, zkLink will refer to Uniswap V3 on concentrated liquidity so that capital eï¬€iciency could be increased by about 4,000 times in the following version.

zkLink v1 will support Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Huobi ECO Chain (HECO), and in the foreseeable future, will also be connected with other smart chains such as Solana, Polygon, Fantom, etc.
