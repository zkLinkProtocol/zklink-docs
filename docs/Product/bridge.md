# Bridge

---


Fast Bridge is multi-chain token mapping instrument on top of zkLink's high-performance and secure chain-to-chain infrastructure, boosting DeFi projects with their multi-chain deployment. Zero-knowledge technology guards the security of multi-chain tokens from being maliciously minted. Different from those controlled by a multi-sig community, new offering request would only be executed once it passes ZK verification.




This could, in turn, hinder the long-term development of DeFi where the only possible path of multi-chain token interoperability is centralized exchanges. Which can only be a temporary remedy rather than a long-term solution in a world that advocates decentralization, since the opportunity cost and risk cost for long-tail users to swap multi-chain assets via a CEX can be unbearably high.

> Imagine that the liquidity from separate chains and Layer2 protocols are connected with each other, wherein multi-chain, multi-layer transaction can be directly executed — it will hugely boost productivity for the DeFi ecosystem as a whole and for the whole blockchain world. zkLink was created for this mission
